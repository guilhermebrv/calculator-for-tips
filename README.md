# Split Bills Calculator

This project marks a significant milestone in my journey through the ["iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp) taught by Angela Yu on Udemy. As part of this course module, I successfully developed an app to calculate the division of expenses among friends, including tips. Throughout the development process, I implemented features to enhance user experience and ensure accurate calculations.

## Key Features

- **Input Validation:** Ensured that only numerical inputs are accepted in the text field for accurate calculations.

- **Empty Field Check:** Implemented logic to check if fields are empty before enabling the calculate button, preventing inaccurate results.

- **Modal Transition:** Created a smooth transition between the calculation screen and the result screen using a modal.

- **MVVM Architecture:** Adopted the MVVM design pattern to enhance code organization and maintainability.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guilhermebrv/calculator-for-tips.git

2. **Open in Xcode:**
- Launch the project in Xcode and run it on your preferred iOS simulator or device.

3. **Explore and Calculate:**
- Enter your expenses, making sure to keep it numerical - because the keyboard won't allow you to type another thing anyway!
- Check that you've filled in all the fields.
- Hit the magical calculate button and witness the results!
